Plan
Text mode demo v1.0
by Richard Cavell

Add BREAK recognition to skip parts

The top part becomes a scrolltext:
Welcome to Name of Demo. Blah blah blah.

A 14-long line appears from middle out. It is made of asterisks.

It rotates 180 degrees. Then pauses. Then rotates another 180 degrees
and pauses. Then it rotates 90 degrees.  Another line is made.
The whole thing rotates 720 degrees.

A cube appears by zooming onto the screen.
Scrolltext: It is a square.

Scrolltext: It rotates!

Scrolltext: Now it is 3D.
Once it has gone through 90 degrees, it rotates about the vertical axis.
It then spins in 3 dimensions. It's made of asterisks.
Scrolltext: Now begone!
The cube then zooms off the screen.

black rises up from the bottom and goes to line 2.
It then drops down, revealing blue.
