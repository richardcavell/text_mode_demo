Plan
Text mode demo v1.0
by Richard Cavell

A routine that receives the loaded machine language and delivers it to upper
32K.
Title screen
A white box appears at the left hand side and sweeps to the right side.
As it passes the letters RJFC appear. Sound effect: Pronunciation of RJFC
A red box appears.
"Presents"
A blue box appears
"Name of Demo"

Add BREAK recognition to skip parts

A buff line comes over the RJFC, and is wiped off from the left.

A red line comes over the Presents

A blue line comes over the Name of Demo

The top part becomes a scrolltext:
Welcome to Name of Demo. Blah blah blah.

A 14-long line appears from middle out. It is made of asterisks.

It rotates 180 degrees. Then pauses. Then rotates another 180 degrees
and pauses. Then it rotates 90 degrees.  Another line is made.
The whole thing rotates 720 degrees.

A cube appears by zooming onto the screen.
Scrolltext: It is a square.

Scrolltext: It rotates!

Scrolltext: Now it is 3D.
Once it has gone through 90 degrees, it rotates about the vertical axis.
It then spins in 3 dimensions. It's made of asterisks.
Scrolltext: Now begone!
The cube then zooms off the screen.

Using semigraphics, black rises up from the bottom and goes to line 2.
It then drops down, revealing blue.
