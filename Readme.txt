Text Mode Demo

v1.0
June 2025

The TRS-80 Color Computer was first sold in 1981. It has a MC6847 chip, that
is capable of producing a 32*16 character text screen.

This is my attempt to create a demo using that text screen.

You need a TRS-80 Color Computer 1, 2, or 3 with at least 32K of RAM.

Greetings to everyone who keeps the retro demo scene alive.
