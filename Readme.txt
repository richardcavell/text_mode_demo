Text Mode Megademo

June 2025 - July 2025

The TRS-80 Color Computer was first sold in 1981. Models 1 and 2 have an
MC6847 chip, and model 3 has a GIME chip, each of which is capable of
producing a 32*16 character text screen.

This is my attempt to create a demo using that text screen.

You need a TRS-80 Color Computer 1, 2, or 3 with at least 32K of RAM.

Greetings to everyone who keeps the retro demo scene alive.
